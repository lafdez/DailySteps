# DailySteps
This would be an application to keep track of the daily steps I walk.

It will be useful to myself to get current with the current software development methodologies and approaches.

The idea it is to make a mobile and a desktop application using the Qt framework. And I hope there will be a webservice developed in Java to which the mobile application will connect to to retrieve and maybe modify the data.
